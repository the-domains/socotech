### [Founders Fight Club Series \#7][0]

March 15, 2016

### SocoNexus - 1300 Valley House Drive \#100, Rohnert Park, CA 

### Founders Fight Club is by founders for founders.  The life of an entrepreneur is tough, some days it feels like you've been in a fight. Every good fighter has a winning team in their corner. Founders Fight Club is a safe place for founders to let down their guard and be vulnerable with the real issues. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/5f66e87b-e066-4634-8a7f-43e2413bd4a8.jpg)
